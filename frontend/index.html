      <h3>You're wondering about Chess history?</h3>
      <br />
      <br>
      <h4>
        Chess is a board game between two players. It is sometimes called
        international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related
        games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess). The
        recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a
        similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. The rules of chess
        as we know them today emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century,
        with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th
        century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played
        by millions of people worldwide.

        Chess is an abstract strategy game and
        involves no hidden information. It is played on a chessboard with 64
        squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player
        controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops,
        two knights, and eight pawns. The player controlling the white pieces
        moves first, followed by the player controlling the black pieces. The
        object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king
        is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to
        escape. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
